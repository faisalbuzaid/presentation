Part of this work was contributed from https://dev.to/bornasepic/pure-and-simple-tic-tac-toe-with-javascript-4pgn and https://www.codesdope.com/blog/article/12-creative-css-and-javascript-text-typing-animati/

The main technologies were used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- javaScript 

By mimicking an existing tic tac toe game, we observed some of the js functionality and we understand how we can make the client-side active by joining the HTML/CSS by the js.
